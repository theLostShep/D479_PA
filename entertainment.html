                <img src="Resources/entertainment.png" alt="Entertainment">Entertainment: Most people visit Taniti to
                enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. However, there are other things to
                do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining
                in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing
                a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a
                nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in
                Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.
